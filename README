# 🚀 Node.js Clustering + Worker Threads in TypeScript

This project demonstrates how to scale a **Node.js application** using **Clustering** and offload **CPU-intensive tasks** using **Worker Threads**, all written in **TypeScript**.

---

## 📌 Features

* ✅ Efficient handling of **high I/O traffic** with **Cluster module**.
* ✅ Offload **CPU-bound computations** (e.g., summing numbers) to **Worker Threads**.
* ✅ Tagged logs for clarity: logs include `process.pid` and thread type.
* ✅ Clean TypeScript structure with logging and error handling.
* ✅ Debug-friendly setup (supports VSCode & Chrome DevTools).

## 🛠️ Project Structure

```
/src
  ├── index.ts         # Cluster setup + HTTP server + Worker Thread trigger
  └── workerTask.ts    # Worker Thread logic (e.g., sum 1..N)

tsconfig.json          # TypeScript configuration
package.json           # Scripts and dependencies
```

---

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone and Install Dependencies

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd node-cluster-worker-ts
npm install
```

### 2. Build TypeScript

```bash
npx tsc
```

### 3. Run the Server

```bash
node dist/index.js
```

## 🔍 How It Works

| Component      | Role                                                                 |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cluster Module | Forks multiple worker processes to utilize all CPU cores             |
| Worker Threads | Handles CPU-heavy computation in parallel inside each worker process |
| HTTP Endpoint  | `/compute?num=N` — computes sum from 1 to N using a Worker Thread    |

---

## 🌐 API Usage

### Compute Sum (CPU task)

```
GET http://localhost:3000/compute?num=100000000
```

### Default Response

```
Result: 5000000050000000, computed by worker thread on process 12345
```

## 🧵 Logging & Debugging Guide

### Logging:

* Logs are tagged with `[Main pid]` or `[Worker pid]`.
* Logs track:

  * Worker start/exit
  * Task received
  * Task completion or errors

### Debugging (VSCode / Chrome):

1. Run with Node Inspector:

   ```bash
   node --inspect-brk dist/index.js
   ```

2. Open Chrome:

   ```
   chrome://inspect
   ```

3. OR Setup in VSCode:

   ```json
   {
     "type": "node",
     "request": "launch",
     "name": "Debug Cluster + Worker",
     "program": "${workspaceFolder}/dist/index.js",
     "autoAttachChildProcesses": true
   }
   ```

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

| Module         | Limitation                                                              |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cluster        | No shared memory; needs Redis/DB for shared state across processes      |
| Worker Threads | Thread pooling not built-in; creating thread per request is inefficient |

### Solutions:

* Use **Redis** or **Postgres** for shared session/cache.
* Use libraries like **workerpool** or **poolifier** for thread pooling.
